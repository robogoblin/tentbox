# reboots.
# We expect that when we start the caller will give us defaults. If we find a file, we
# use that to override the data found.
# When a sensor config is updated we will write the config to a json file on disk.
# We do readings every 15 seconds and cache the results. We expect that there will
# be many failures when doing readings, we'll just cache the success results.
# The manager is expected to run in a separate process and share a cache with the
# web server. Although not strictly required.
# Because of this we expect the caller to supply a dict that we can use to cache
# data in.
